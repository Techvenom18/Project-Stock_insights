##IF The error indicates that the yfinance module is not installed in this environment, so I can't fetch live financial data directly here.
##However, you can run the following code in your local Jupyter Notebook (where yfinance is installed) to generate and save the CSV file

#Jupyter Notebook Code to Create CSV

import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import datetime as dt

# Define ticker symbols and date range
tickers = ['^NSEI', 'HCLTECH.NS']
start = dt.datetime(2011, 1, 1)
end = dt.datetime(2022, 12, 31)

# Download 'Close' price data
data = {}
for symbol in tickers:
    data[symbol] = yf.download(symbol, start=start, end=end)[['Close']]

# Merge data and rename columns
df = pd.concat(data, axis=1)
df.columns = ['Nifty', 'HCL']

# Save to CSV
df.to_csv("Nifty_HCL_Close_2011_2022.csv", index=True)

print("âœ… CSV file created: Nifty_HCL_Close_2011_2022.csv")
